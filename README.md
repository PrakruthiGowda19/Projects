Hi there! I'm Prakruthi, a recent graduate with a passion for data analysis.

ðŸ“Š As a data analyst, I thrive on uncovering insights and patterns within complex datasets to drive informed decision-making and strategic planning. I have a strong foundation in statistical analysis, data visualization, and database management, acquired through coursework and hands-on projects at my previous workplace as an Implementation Consultant at LTI.

ðŸ’¼ In my recent role as an insurance administrator, I honed my attention to detail and organizational skills while managing policy documentation, client support, and compliance processes. This experience has equipped me with a unique perspective on data integrity and information management within the insurance brokerage industry.

ðŸ”§ I am proficient in tools like Excel, SQL, and Python libraries, and Power BI. I am eager to apply my analytical skills and industry knowledge to contribute meaningfully to data-driven initiatives in any organization.
