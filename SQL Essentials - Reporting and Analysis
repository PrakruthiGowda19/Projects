SQL Essentials - Reporting and Analysis Project
This module contains the exercises, projects, and scripts I developed while completing the "SQL Essential Training" course by Walter Shields. The course provided a comprehensive understanding of SQL fundamentals, including:

Writing basic SQL queries to retrieve data from databases
Using SQL functions to perform calculations and data manipulation
Joining tables to extract data from multiple sources
Aggregating and filtering data to generate meaningful reports
Working with complex queries for advanced data analysis
Iâ€™ve applied these skills in several hands-on projects that demonstrate practical applications of SQL for solving data-related challenges. Feel free to explore the scripts and queries within this repository!
